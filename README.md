# Link List

A web application that uses MongoDB and Express to allow users to save links to web pages and other web resources.

I was inspired to make this application by my experience of suddenly realizing I had 40 different tabs open while working on a coding project. They contained very specific information, so I didn't want to bookmark them, but I also wanted to keep them as references without overtaxing my computer. 

I use a Chrome extension that manages tabs, but it only displays the tab's name as a link, without any other information like notes about the tab or screenshots to remind me what's on the tab. 

This app stores links to web pages on a database, but unlike the Chrome extension it also lets the user store a description of the resource as well as tags so the resource can be catalogued on the database and an imbedded video (in the case of the resource being a YouTube video) or screenshot that the application automatically captures and stores when the link is added to the database.
